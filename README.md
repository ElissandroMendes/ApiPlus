# API Plus for Magento

API Plus for Magento is a module that improves how Magendo API can be consumed by thirty part applications. By using API Plus in your Magento store you make the API connection much eaiser but with the same abstraction and providing the same flexibility that Magento platform already provides for all its community.

## NOTE

This documentation is not complete but I'm working on it to improve and make it better everytime I have a little free time.

## Features

- **Much easier!**: API Plus is much, much, much easier to be used in your Magento platform. By using it you don't need to make SOAP calls anymore.
- **Flexibility**: API Plus uses the Magento API's abstraction so, the same flexibility is provided by API Plus.
- **Security**: API Plus is as secure as Magento's authentication system.
- **Performance**: By using API Plus your API connections and results will be much faster then using the default SOAP calls.
